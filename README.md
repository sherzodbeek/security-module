Module 4: Authentication and Authorization

(1 start)
1. Create Spring Boot MVC project.
2. Create REST endpoint "GET /info" that provide random stats (ex: "MVC application"). Test this endpoint.
3. Add Spring Security module to your project and configure it for authenticated access to all resources. Use email/password combination for it.


4. Use a non-embedded DB to store users.
5. Use salt and hashing to store user passwords.
6. Create additional REST endpoint "GET /about" and configure non-authenticated access to it.

7. Create one more REST endpoint "GET /admin".
8. Now you need to add authorised access to "GET /info" and "GET /admin", add "VIEW_INFO", "VIEW_ADMIN" permissions for it. Create 3 users with different combination of permissions.
9. Create new Login/Logout pages and configure Spring Security to use new Login/Logout.
10. Add Brute Force protector. BLock user email for 5 minute on 3 unsuccessful login.
11. Create an endpoint to show blocked users
